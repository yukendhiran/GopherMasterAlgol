To find all subsets of a set, we can use bitmasking technique. This involves representing each subset as a binary number, where each bit indicates whether a particular element is included in the subset.

- The total number of subsets of a set with N elements is 2^N. This is because each element can either be included or excluded from a subset, resulting in 2N2N combinations.
- By iterating over binary numbers from 0 to 2N−12N−1, you can generate all possible subsets. Each bit in the binary number indicates whether the corresponding element is included in the subset.

<CodeBlock language="go">{Subset}</CodeBlock>

Output:

<CodeBlock language="text">{SubsetOut}</CodeBlock>
