import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import Xor from "!!raw-loader!./xor.go";
import XorOut from "!!raw-loader!./xorOut.txt";

The XOR operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the bits are different, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.

<CodeBlock language="go">{Xor}</CodeBlock>

Output:

<CodeBlock language="text">{XorOut}</CodeBlock>
