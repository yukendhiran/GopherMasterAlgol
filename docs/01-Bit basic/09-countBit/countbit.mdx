title: Count 1's in Bit
---

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import CountBit from "!!raw-loader!./countBit.go";
import CountBitOut from "!!raw-loader!./countBitOut.txt";

There are two ways to count the number of ones in a given number:

- The first approach involves using a bitwise AND operation to extract the last bit and check if it is equal to one. If it is, you can increment a counter. Then, you can right shift the number to move the bits and repeat the process until all ones have been counted.

- The second approach involves performing an AND operation with num - 1 to remove the rightmost bit from the number. This process effectively removes all ones from the number, and the number of iterations required to do so will be the answer.

<CodeBlock language="go">{CountBit}</CodeBlock>

Output:

<CodeBlock language="text">{CountBitOut}</CodeBlock>
