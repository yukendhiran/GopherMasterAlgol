title: AND (&)
---

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import And from "!!raw-loader!./and.go";
import AndOut from "!!raw-loader!./andOut.txt";

The AND operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit
of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.

<CodeBlock language="go">{And}</CodeBlock>

Output:

<CodeBlock language="text">{AndOut}</CodeBlock>
