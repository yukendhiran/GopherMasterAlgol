While Go does not have a unary bitwise NOT (~) operator, it achieves the same functionality using the caret (^) as a bitwise complement operator. This operator flips each bit of its operand, providing bitwise negation functionality in Go.

<CodeBlock language="go">{Not}</CodeBlock>

Output:

<CodeBlock language="text">{NotOut}</CodeBlock>{" "}

In Go, the bitwise complement operator `^` flips each bit of its integer operand. This operation is based on the two's complement representation of integers.

### For `int` type (`a`)

- `var a int = 0` initializes `a` to `0`.
- In binary (assuming 32-bit integer): `00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000`
- Applying `^a` (bitwise complement) flips each bit:
  ** Resulting binary: `11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111`
  ** The leftmost bit (most significant bit) is the sign bit.
  ** `0` indicates a non-negative number, and `1` indicates a negative number.
  ** Flipping all bits of `00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000` results in `11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111`, which represents `-1`.
- Therefore, `fmt.Println(^a)` outputs `-1`.

### For `uint8` type (`b`)

- `var b uint8 = 0` initializes `b` to `0`.
- `uint8` is an unsigned 8-bit integer ranging from `0` to `255`.
- In binary (8-bit): `00000000`
- Applying `^b` (bitwise complement) flips each bit:
  ** Resulting binary: `11111111`
  ** In unsigned interpretation, `11111111` represents `255` in decimal.
- Therefore, `fmt.Println(^b)` outputs `255`.
