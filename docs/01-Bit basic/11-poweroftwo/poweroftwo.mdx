title: Power Of Two
---

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import PowerOftwo from "!!raw-loader!./poweroftwo.go";
import PowerOfTwoOut from "!!raw-loader!./poweroftwoOut.txt";

To determine if a number is a power of two, we can perform a bitwise AND operation between the number and its previous number. If the result is zero, then the number is a power of two. Otherwise, the result will be some other number.

<CodeBlock language="go">{PowerOftwo}</CodeBlock>

Output:

<CodeBlock language="text">{PowerOfTwoOut}</CodeBlock>
