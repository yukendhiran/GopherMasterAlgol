title: Odd or Even Check Using Bitwise AND
---

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import OddEven from "!!raw-loader!./oddeven.go";
import OddEvenOut from "!!raw-loader!./oddevenOut.txt";

To determine if a number is odd or even, you can use the bitwise AND operator (`&`). By performing a bitwise AND between the number and `1`, you can check the least significant bit (the last bit) of the number:
- If the result is `0`, the number is even.
- If the result is `1`, the number is odd.

This is because the binary representation of even numbers always ends in `0`, and the binary representation of odd numbers always ends in `1`.

<CodeBlock language="go">{OddEven}</CodeBlock>

Output:

<CodeBlock language="text">{OddEvenOut}</CodeBlock>
