title: Left Shift Operator (`<<`)
---

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import LeftShift from "!!raw-loader!./leftshift.go";
import LeftShiftOut from "!!raw-loader!./leftshiftOut.txt";

The left shift operator (`<<`) shifts the bits of its left-hand operand to the left by the number of positions specified by its right-hand operand. Each left shift operation essentially multiplies the number by `2` raised to the power of the number of positions shifted.

Example with `var a int = 1`:

- Binary representation of `1`: `00000001`
- `1 << 1`: shifts the bits one position to the left, resulting in `00000010`, which is `2` in decimal.
- `1 << 2`: shifts the bits two positions to the left, resulting in `00000100`, which is `4` in decimal.
- `1 << 3`: shifts the bits three positions to the left, resulting in `00001000`, which is `8` in decimal.

Pattern explanation:

- Each shift to the left introduces a `0` at the least significant bit (rightmost position), effectively multiplying the number by `2`.
