title: OR (`|`)
---

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import Or from "!!raw-loader!./or.go";
import OrOut from "!!raw-loader!./orOut.txt";

The OR operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.

<CodeBlock language="go">{Or}</CodeBlock>

Output:

<CodeBlock language="text">{OrOut}</CodeBlock>
