The `binaryExponentiation` function calculates the power of a number using an efficient method known as binary exponentiation. This method reduces the number of multiplications needed by utilizing the binary representation of the exponent.

## Explanation

The `binaryExponentiation` function computes \( a^b \) using the following approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `result := 1`: Initialize the result to 1.
2. **Loop until `b` is greater than 0**:

   - `if b & 1 == 1`: Check if the least significant bit of `b` is 1 (i.e., `b` is odd).
     - If true, multiply `result` by `a`.
   - `a = a * a`: Square the base `a`.
   - `b = b >> 1`: Right-shift the exponent `b` by 1 (equivalent to dividing `b` by 2).

3. **Return the final result**.

   - This method effectively reduces the time complexity to \( O(\log b) \) compared to the naive approach which has a time complexity of \( O(b) \).
