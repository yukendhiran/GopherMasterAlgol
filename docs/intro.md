## Introduction

Hi, I'm Yukendhiran. I'm diving into algorithms and Go programming, and I've decided to turn this journey into a docs | course.

If you're wondering why Go instead of languages like Java or C++, well, I'm part of a community that questions OOP and humorously dislikes C++. Go was designed to solve fundamental software development challenges, making it an ideal choice for learning algorithms.
